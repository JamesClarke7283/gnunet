/**
 * Maintains the ego list for an escrow plugin.
 * This function is an implementation of GNUNET_IDENTITY_Callback.
 *
 * It is initially called for all egos and then again
 * whenever a ego's identifier changes or if it is deleted.  At the
 * end of the initial pass over all egos, the function is once called
 * with 'NULL' for 'ego'. That does NOT mean that the callback won't
 * be invoked in the future or that there was an error.
 *
 * When used with 'GNUNET_IDENTITY_create' or 'GNUNET_IDENTITY_get',
 * this function is only called ONCE, and 'NULL' being passed in
 * 'ego' does indicate an error (i.e. name is taken or no default
 * value is known).  If 'ego' is non-NULL and if '*ctx'
 * is set in those callbacks, the value WILL be passed to a subsequent
 * call to the identity callback of 'GNUNET_IDENTITY_connect' (if
 * that one was not NULL).
 *
 * When an identity is renamed, this function is called with the
 * (known) ego but the NEW identifier.
 *
 * When an identity is deleted, this function is called with the
 * (known) ego and "NULL" for the 'identifier'.  In this case,
 * the 'ego' is henceforth invalid (and the 'ctx' should also be
 * cleaned up).
 *
 * @param cls plugin handle
 * @param ego ego handle
 * @param ctx context for application to store data for this ego
 *                 (during the lifetime of this process, initially NULL)
 * @param identifier identifier assigned by the user for this ego,
 *                   NULL if the user just deleted the ego and it
 *                   must thus no longer be used

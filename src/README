# Folder layout

  - lib/ : Core libraries. Does not contain any binaries.
  - service/: Core services. Contains services and daemons.
  - plugin/: ltlibraries/dlload plugins. DBs, REST, Block etc.
  - contrib/: Third-party, experimental or currently unmaintained components. Also has lib/service/plugin layout.

# Open issues:

  - Separate folder for daemons after service? daemon/
  - Separate folder for tests after plugin? test/
  - Separate folder for configuration? conf/
  - Possibly move arm and testing into lib and rename it to base/
